\title{Guess the \dQuote{span} for a demographic dimension}
\usage{
guess_span_from_start(x)

guess_span_for_dimension_for_df(x, dimension = get_all_dimensions_w_spans())
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Vector of \dQuote{start} values (e.g., the
\code{time_start} or \code{age_start} column from a
\code{\link{demog_change_component_df}} object).}

\item{dimension}{A single demographic dimension with a
\dQuote{span} (e.g., \dQuote{age}, \dQuote{time}).}
}
\value{
Guessed span.
}
\description{
Certain demographic dimensions, such as \dQuote{time} and
\dQuote{age} have associated spans. These should ordinarily be
supplied by the user when calling, e.g.,
\code{\link{demog_change_component_df}}, but a very simple guess
will be attempted if not. Currently, the smallest difference
between successive values in the corresponding
\dQuote{\code{_start}} column is
returned. \code{guess_span_from_start} takes a
vector of \dQuote{\code{_start}} values as first argument;
\code{guess_span_for_dimension_for_df} is a convenience wrapper
that takes a data frame with such a column instead.
